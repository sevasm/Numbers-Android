To compile and install this application to an Android device:
0. Set up your Android development environment. A guide on how to do this
   can be found here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html
1. Checkout project from the repository
2. Import it into Eclipse. The application has a dependency on the Numbers-Core
   project, which has been packaged as numbers-core.jar in the lib folder for
   convenience and is included in the project classpath. Alternatively, the
   Numbers-Core project can also be checked out and Eclipse can be told to use
   it instead of the provided JAR file.
3. Attach an Android device
4. Tell Eclipse to run the project as an Android Application and choose your
   device when prompted
